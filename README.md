TF2Attributes SourceMod Extension

Reimplements the popular plugin of the same name as an extension. You must run a compiled version of sourcemod from this PR alliedmodders/sourcemod#2196
Updating to the extension version should be as simple as a plugin recompile. However some natives have been changed or removed, you might need to update your plugin source code.
